## Supercharge Your LLM to Get Things Done! 🚀

Welcome to **Octasks**—the tool that turns your "I should probably do something about that..." into a clear, actionable plan! We provide specially designed prompts that you can use with your favorite Large Language Model (LLM), like **ChatGPT** or **LLama**, to help you achieve your goals without the usual head-scratching.

## What's Octasks? 🐙

Let's face it: we've all had moments where our to-do lists look like ancient hieroglyphics. Octasks is here to rescue you from the chaos! By providing you with powerful prompts to use with any LLM, we help turn your brilliant (or not-so-brilliant) ideas into well-defined tasks.

Whether you're planning to conquer the world or just finally clean out the garage, Octasks offers two prompt versions to suit your needs:

-   [**Insights Mode**](./prompts/Octasks_Insights.txt) 🕵️: Think of it as a friendly chat where the LLM asks you questions to understand exactly what you're aiming for.
-   [**Express Mode**](./prompts/Octasks_Express.txt) ⚡: For when you need a task definition faster than you can say "procrastination."

## Why Use Octasks? 🤔

-   **Clarity and Focus 🔍**: Because "Do the thing" isn't exactly helpful.
-   **Time-Saving ⏳**: Spend less time planning and more time doing—or binge-watching; we don't judge.
-   **Customization 🎨**: Tailor your task definitions to fit your unique quirks and constraints.
-   **Improved Productivity 📈**: Turn your "maybe someday" into "done and dusted."
-   **Versatility 🔄**: Suitable for world domination plans and weekend DIY projects alike.

## Who Is It For? 👥

Octasks is for anyone whose to-do list is giving them the side-eye:

-   **Project Managers 🗂️**: Keep your team on the same page instead of different planets.
-   **Entrepreneurs 💡**: Because starting a business is hard enough without vague goals.
-   **Students 📚**: Turn "study stuff" into an actual study plan.
-   **Individuals 🏃‍♂️**: For those personal goals you've been meaning to get around to—yes, we mean that new hobby.
-   **Teams 🤝**: Collaborate without the confusion and accidental "Reply All" emails.

## How Does It Work? ⚙️

Octasks provides [two prompt templates](./prompts) that you can use with your preferred LLM to generate comprehensive task definitions. It's like having a personal assistant, minus the awkward small talk.

### Insights Mode 🕵️

The [**Insights Mode** prompt](./prompts/Octasks_Insights.txt) enables an interactive session with the LLM, where it asks you a series of targeted questions to create a detailed task definition tailored to your needs. Think of it as a friendly interrogation—but with fewer bright lights.

**How to Use Insights Mode:**

1. **Copy the Prompt 📋**: Find the ["Insights Mode" prompt](./prompts/Octasks_Insights.txt) in the repository.
2. **Paste into LLM 💻**: Open your preferred LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) and paste the prompt into the chat.
3. **Engage in Conversation 🗣️**: The LLM will start by greeting you and asking questions about your task.
4. **Answer the Questions 📝**: Spill the beans about your grand plans.
5. **Review the Task Definition 🔍**: The LLM will generate a task definition based on your answers.
6. **Request Revisions if Needed 🔄**: Because even AI can't read minds—yet.

**Example:**

-   **You**: _[Paste the Insights Mode prompt into ChatGPT]_
-   **ChatGPT**: Hello! I'm here to help you define your task clearly and effectively. To get started, could you please tell me the main goal of your task?
-   **You**: I want to plan a surprise birthday party for my best friend.
-   _[The conversation continues with more questions and answers]_
-   **ChatGPT**: Based on our conversation, here's your task definition:
    -   _[Provides the detailed task definition]_

### Express Mode ⚡

The [**Express Mode** prompt](./prompts/Octasks_Express.txt) allows the LLM to generate a task definition based on a specified field or area with minimal input from you. Perfect for when you're in a hurry or just feeling a bit lazy (we've all been there).

**How to Use Express Mode:**

1. **Copy the Prompt 📋**: Find the ["Express Mode" prompt](./prompts/Octasks_Express.txt) in the repository.
2. **Paste into LLM 💻**: Open your LLM and paste the prompt into the chat.
3. **Specify the Field or Area 🌐**: When prompted, tell the LLM the general area you're interested in. "World peace," perhaps?
4. **Receive the Task Definition 🎁**: The LLM will work its magic.
5. **Request Revisions if Needed 🔄**: Or just sit back and admire the efficiency.

**Example:**

-   **You**: _[Paste the Express Mode prompt into ChatGPT]_
-   **ChatGPT**: Hello! I'm here to help you by generating a task definition. Could you please tell me the field or area you're interested in?
-   **You**: Baking the perfect sourdough bread.
-   **ChatGPT**: Based on your interest, here's a task definition:
    -   _[Provides the detailed task definition]_

## Getting Started 🛠️

1. **Download the Prompts ⬇️**: They're not hiding, we promise.
2. **Choose Your LLM 🤖**: Pick your favorite AI buddy (ChatGPT, LLama, or even that obscure one your friend keeps mentioning).
3. **Select a Mode 🎯**: Do you want a deep conversation or a quick fix?
4. **Follow the Instructions 📖**: We made them as straightforward as possible—no secret handshakes required.
5. **Interact and Review 👀**: Engage with the LLM and marvel at the task definition it generates.

## Pro Tips 💡

-   **Be Specific 🧐**: The LLM isn't a mind reader (yet), so details help.
-   **Think About Constraints ⛓️**: Mention any limitations like time, budget, or your cat's approval.
-   **Define Success 🏆**: What does "nailed it" look like for you?
-   **Review and Refine 🔄**: Don't be shy—ask for changes if needed.
-   **Try Different Scenarios 🎲**: Mix it up! Who knows what brilliant plans you'll come up with next?
