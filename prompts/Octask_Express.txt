Title: Development of an AI-Powered Diagnostic Tool for Early Disease Detection

Objective:

To create an artificial intelligence system that assists healthcare professionals in early detection of diseases by analyzing medical imaging data.

Scope:

- Included: Designing algorithms for image recognition, integrating machine learning models, testing with sample data.
- Excluded: Clinical trials, regulatory approval processes, patient data collection.

Requirements:

- Develop a convolutional neural network for image analysis.
- Train the model using publicly available medical imaging datasets.
- Ensure the tool can identify at least three specific diseases with high accuracy.
- Document the development process and provide user guidelines.

Constraints:

- Project completion within nine months.
- Adherence to data privacy laws and ethical guidelines.
- Limited budget of $200,000.

Success Criteria:

- Achieving an accuracy rate of over 90% in disease detection.
- Positive feedback from a panel of medical professionals during demonstrations.
- Successful integration of the tool with existing healthcare software systems.
